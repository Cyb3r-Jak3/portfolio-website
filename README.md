This is source code for my website.  
All this repo contains is the html, css and javascript as well as other assorted files. I have a docker image that I use to test my HTML and CSS available [here](https://github.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/html5validator-docker).

My resume is also available if you would rather download it from here as well as my public key.
